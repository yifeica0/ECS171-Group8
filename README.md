1. Model list
ML: SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
DL: CNNs, RNNs, LSTM

2. Model Development
can write a <.py> file under </Models>, or write it directly in a <.ipynb> under </ModelTraining>
3. Model Training
can copy exists file and edit by yourself (DL: LSTM; FE+ ML: TFDIF+RF; Regular ML: RF)
4. Model Evalution
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix (TP/FP/FN/TN), ?approach graph
