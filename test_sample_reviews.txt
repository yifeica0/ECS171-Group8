The food was not good at all.
I wouldn't say the movie was bad, but it certainly wasn't great.
The service was nothing short of spectacular.
I’ve had better coffee, but this is not the worst.
Oh great, another not-so-wonderful update from the team.
There is no way I am recommending this place.
It’s not just good, it’s life-changing.
The plot was not exactly easy to follow.
I can hardly say I enjoyed the experience.
If you think this is a good product, you're not paying attention.
